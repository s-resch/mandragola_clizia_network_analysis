# Machiavelli's Mandragola and Clizia - Digital Network Analysis

Repository containing material for a digital network analysis using Gephi and Python as described in Sascha Resch's essay "Mandragola und Clizia aus der Perspektive der digitalen Netzwerkanalyse", published in _Philologie im Netz_ 97 (2024)

# Textual material

The digital text versions of _Mandragola_ and _Clizia_ used for the analysis are taken from _DraCor_ (https://dracor.org/), which themselves derive from _Biblioteca Italiana_ (http://www.bibliotecaitaliana.it/). The text files are named as "\_Interaction" files as they contain the enhancements made by Sascha Resch in order to extract an interactional network. Still, they were used for retrieving the co-occurences, as well, as the annotations for the interaction graph don't remove information about co-occurences. For detailed references see Sascha Resch's essay "Mandragola und Clizia aus der Perspektive der digitalen Netzwerkanalyse". You can find the further annotated versions of these TEI XML files in this repository

# Results/Python scripts

In this repository you find the results of the analysis as PNG and Gephi project files. Furthermore, you find the Python scripts used to extract the data from _Mandragola_ and _Clizia_ needed for network analysis.
